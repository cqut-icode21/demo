<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted
  <br/>from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern
  <br/>dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
  <li>175g of tahini</li>
  <li>6 sundries tomatoes</li>
  <li>Half a red pepper</li>
  <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper
    <!--  嵌套列表 -->
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
      <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
      <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
      <!-- <i>倾斜 <b>粗体 <u>下划线 -->
      <li>If you want a <i>smooth</i> <b>hummus</b>, <u>process</u> it for a longer time</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
  <!-- 强调嵌套 -->
  <li>A <strong>dash <em>of olive</em></strong> oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
  <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
  <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
  <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
  <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
  <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
</ol>

<p>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and
  <br/>coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach
  <br/>and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to
  <br/>use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy,
  <br/>you should definitely discard it.
</p>

<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
